# Example service

This is an example service for Authly integration.

It features a simple status UI (exposed as http://localhost:8080/testservice in the Kubernetes example setup), which shows connection status for the service and its configured authorization attributes, and example user authentication ("User" tab â€“ try `testuser`/`secret` as credentials).
